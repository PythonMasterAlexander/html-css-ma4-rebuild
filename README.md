Rebuild of MA4 in html & css course on Noroff front-end Development

Teacher feedback on the original assignment grade - 6/10

Hi Alexander

The site is responsive which is good to see although the brief does ask for three columns and yours only has a two column layout which wraps down.

The nav element gets closed on the same line as it gets opened.

The image on the home page doesn't come through. You just need to remove the '/' at the start of the filepath.

The article tag is for articles you'd find on a magazine or newspaper website.

The footer is outside the body element on the form.html page.

Media queries should overwrite global styles, so please put your media query at the bottom of your stylesheet. It'll also help ensure you don't overwrite styles that you want to change using the media query.

PS. If you're interested in using a hamburger menu, you can use the checkbox hack to help with that. https://scrimba.com/c/ceM3paHb

1) Fix teachers feedback mistakes.

2) Improve font selection for headers and text.

3) Improve colors and site layout.
